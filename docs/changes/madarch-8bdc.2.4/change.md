# The state machines of the code, as a static stage of the fill

Change: madarch-8bdc.2.4
Base: ad6c2f9d97304b9f67598c085f19faee99385eb4
Tasks: madarch-8bdc.2.4
Kind: behavior

## Intent
Decision 0033 makes the file the unit of static work (items 5 and 14) and makes
every next step read what the earlier ones published (item 15). The state
machines a file writes down were the last reading of the code outside that
shape that a reader of a page still made: `src/knowledge/views.ts` called
`src/knowledge/state-machines.ts` on the bytes at render time, so a diagram of
an entity's states was neither a published record nor something the graph could
hold a verification state for. This change lands those records as a stage of
the fill: one unit per source file, the file's own bytes, the machines, states
and moves published through the graph store's one unit publication in the
extractors' `code.*` vocabulary, with a coverage node per file.

Stories:
- As a reader of a product's wiki, I open an order's state diagram and it is
  drawn from the graph the fill published, not re-read from the source on every
  page view.
- As a person filling a product, a second run of one commit re-reads no file
  the earlier run read, because each unit's own coverage names the blob it read.
- As the engineer who lands the next stages, a static stage's shape is the one
  this stage shows: one file per unit, its bytes from the stage context, and its
  publication through `GraphStore.publishUnit`.

## Out of scope
- The operations, contracts and data-model readings of task madarch-8bdc.2.4
  stay with the extract driver on this branch. Their stages read expressions,
  bindings, call sites and library effects that no published fact holds — the
  static graph holds symbols, mentions and resolved occurrences — so a per-file
  stage for them needs a per-file code-fact source this task does not hold.
  madarch-8bdc.2.5 deletes the driver with them.
- The wiki's diagram rendering is not moved onto the published records here:
  `src/knowledge/views.ts` still reads the source through its render context,
  which the page capability's own change owns.
- The state reader itself (`src/knowledge/state-machines.ts`) is unchanged: the
  stage calls it on one file's bytes, and a reader that is still called is not a
  path to delete (decision 0033, item 6).

## Changes to requirements
`fill-stages` gains one requirement, "static": what a static stage is handed,
how its units are named and published, what it publishes for a file it could not
read, and how its plan names a unit again. The proposed capability file is
`capabilities/fill-stages.md`.

## Preserved contracts
- fill-stages/registry: a stage is still one module plus one registration, its id, version, consumes, produces, schema and defaults unchanged in shape; the state-machines stage is registered once, beside the others.
- fill-stages/graph: the stage graph is still derived from the declarations; the new stage consumes `file` and nothing else, so its edge runs from the snapshot.
- fill-stages/starvation: a run whose graph holds no file facts still reports the new stage as starved by its exact path, as before.
- fill-orchestrator/publish: a static unit's records still land through the one publication transaction, fenced, exactly once, and scoped to the unit.
- fill-orchestrator/plan: a unit is still planned only when what it stands on moved; the stage's own coverage is the record the plan compares, and a second run of one commit plans nothing.
- fill-orchestrator/completion: a run still finishes with what it covered; a file this stage could not read is a named gap of its unit, never a missing unit.

## Where it is seen
Kind: command
Place: `MADARCH_SKIP_PERF=1 bun test test/fill-state-machines-stage.test.ts` in a checkout

1. A person runs the test; the product the test writes is filled, and the graph
   holds one `code.state-machine` node for each table the fixture's two source
   files write, its `code.state` nodes and its `code.transitions` edges, each
   naming the state it leaves and the state it enters.
2. The same run plans one unit per source file and none for the document or the
   data file, and each machine is declared by its file's node and holds its own states by `code.contains`, and no machine stands among a file's `code.contains` children.
3. A second run of the same commit plans no unit of the stage.

## Blocking questions
None.

## Design and decisions
`src/fill/stages/state-machines.ts` is the stage. Its plan reads this stage's
own coverage (one additive read case in `src/fill/stages/static-reads.ts`,
recorded, rechecked and replayed like every other static read), compares each
source file's blob with the pinned commit, and names a unit for a file whose
blob moved and for a published path the commit no longer holds. Its unit reads
one file's bytes from the static context, decodes them fatally, runs the
existing reader, and writes the machine, state and transition drafts and one
coverage node carrying the blob. `static-stage-boundaries.json` covers the
stage with no exception; `CODE_GRAPH_VOCABULARY` gains the two kinds and the one
relation it publishes.

A file's `code.contains` children are its symbols to the resolution stage, and a machine written there made that stage refuse the file (measured: both of the fixture's files failed their resolution unit before the relation moved to `code.declares`). Writing the plan's read as its own case keeps the shared read reader additive:
no other read changed, and the case names the reader it answers
(`madarch-state-machines`) so no other stage's coverage of the same file is
taken for this one's.

## Acceptance evidence
Recorded beside the branch's report (`/work/out/report-8bdc24.md`): the focused
tests, `bun run check`, the StrykerJS run on the stage's lines, and the peak
memory of the new test.

## DONE WHEN
The stage publishes the machines, states and moves of every source file that
writes a table, one unit per file, through the graph store's one publication;
the boundary check covers it with no exception; a second run of one commit plans
no unit; and the focused tests and `bun run check` pass. The three extract
stages the task also names are not ported: the report says what was measured and
why, and what of the old path remains for madarch-8bdc.2.5.
